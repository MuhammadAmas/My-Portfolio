      "I reached out to Amas on very short notice as my Front End team became unavailable just before I had to demo the project to my client. He understood the flow and code requirements instantly and got to work. Something was scheduled for another dev team for almost a month and in their unavailability, Amas worked relentlessly and gave me a pixel-perfect conversion of the Figma design in less than 3 days. I had nothing to worry about as I handed him over the files, he actively updated me with everything that was going on so I could stay in the loop. His communication skills and cooperation helped me deliver the project on time. Given it was a very short deadline, I was worried he wouldn't be able to complete it all but he went beyond my expectations. I highly recommend Amas for Front End!",
